# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm

## Description

This project implements the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, an optimization method based on the social behavior of swarms. PSO is used to solve multidimensional optimization problems and is known for its efficiency in finding optimal solutions in complex search spaces.

## Features

- Implementation of the PSO algorithm.
- Ability to experiment with different configurations of cognitive and social coefficients.
- Optimization in spaces of up to 20 dimensions.
- Customizable objective functions to evaluate algorithm performance.

## Installation

To run this project, make sure you have Python 3.7.9 and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Clone this repository on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danybasulto/pso-algorithm.git
cd pso-algorithm
```

## Use

To run the PSO algorithm, use the main.py file. This file contains the main function that starts multiple experiments with different configurations of dimensions and cognitive coefficients.

```bash
python main.py
```
